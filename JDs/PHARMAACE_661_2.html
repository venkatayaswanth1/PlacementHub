            <h4>Job Description</h4>
            <div>We are seeking passionate AI Trainee Engineers (Frontend / Backend) eager to dive deep into AI-driven
solution and product development. This role goes far beyond traditional coding — it’s a rare opportunity to
work hands-on with real-world Gen AI / Agentic AI systems, exploring advanced LLMs, NLP pipelines, and
RAG architectures for solving complex healthcare analytics problems. You will work with senior AI engineers
and researchers to develop real-world NLP systems for enterprise use cases tailored to the Pharmaceutical
Industry.
Responsibilities
• Experience in using different open-source libraries Pandas, Tensorflow, PyTorch. Research and
experiment with cutting-edge GenAI and Agentic AI models for real-world use cases
• Collaborate in building scalable AI-based applications — from intuitive frontends to efficient
backends
• Work on data extraction, NER, text summarization, and semantic search problems using advanced
NLP tools
• Integrate LLMs (OpenAI, Gemini, Cohere, DeepSeek, etc.) into custom applications for Chatbots,
Question Answering, and Document Understanding
• Apply prompt engineering, embedding techniques, and RAG strategies for building intelligent AI
agents
• Clean and structure unstructured text data from varied sources like PDFs, PPTs, and web pages using
tools like PyMuPDF, PDFMiner, Tesseract, BeautifulSoup, Selenium, etc
• Contribute to the AI infrastructure stack involving vector databases (Pinecone, FAISS, ChromaDB),
transformer models (BERT, T5, RoBERTa), and backend APIs</div>
