Job Description - GILP Campaign Associate

When you picture yourself at the beginning of your career, what comes to your mind? A cubicle? A
9-to-5 job? Building Excel models to structure financial products? Hustling to launch a product in a
new city? Pitching your business idea to potential investors? Working as part of a larger software
team on a subset of a project? Researching legal positions and advising clients?
We are confident that most likely you will end up doing these things as part of a reputed
organization, working with good people in a steady job. And there is absolutely nothing wrong with
that. If this aligns with your career aspirations, you can stop reading now, and we wish you the
best in your career.
However, if this is not quite enough for you, imagine this: Sitting with a senior political leader,
understanding local issues and political trends. Brainstorming with your team to design an
impactful mass voter outreach campaign. Crafting narratives that shape public opinion and
coordinating the production of ad films that align with your campaign's brand identity. Engaging in
grassroots implementation and enabling direct engagement between senior political leaders and
voters. Analysing data and suggesting course-correction to increase campaign's impact.
Witnessing the tangible impact of your work on real people by solving real problems. And doing all
this while supporting Prime Minister Modi and his party in their vision to build a new India.
If this vision excites you, we have a role for you. If making a real impact is your priority, we
welcome you to the Graduate Impact Leadership Program (GILP).
