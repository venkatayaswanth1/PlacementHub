            <h4>Job Description</h4>
            <div>Nation with NaMo: The Graduate Impact Leadership Program (GILP) 2026

Associate

When you picture yourself at the beginning of your career, what comes to your mind? A cubicle? A
9-to-5 job? Building Excel models to structure financial products? Hustling to launch a product in a
new city? Pitching your business idea to potential investors? Working as part of a larger software
team on a subset of a project? Researching legal positions and advising clients?
We are confident that most likely you will end up doing these things as part of a reputed
organization, working with good people in a steady job. And there is absolutely nothing wrong with
that. If this aligns with your career aspirations, you can stop reading now, and we wish you the
best in your career.
However, if this is not quite enough for you, imagine this: Sitting in a village, understanding local
issues and political trends. Brainstorm with your team to design an impactful election campaign.
Strategizing with political stakeholders. Crafting messages that shape public opinion. Engaging in
grassroots implementation to bring the campaign to the masses. Developing policy suggestions for
election manifestos. Analyzing real-time data to predict electoral outcomes. Witnessing the
tangible impact of your work on real people by solving real problems. And doing all this while
supporting Prime Minister Modi and his party in their vision to build a new India.
