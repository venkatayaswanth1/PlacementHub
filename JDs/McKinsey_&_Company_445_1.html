            <h4>Job Description</h4>
            <div>Your Impact
As a business analyst, you will join a client service team and take ownership of a workstream to solve some of the toughest challenges our clients
face.
And these aren’t just any clients—they're some of the most influential organizations around, from Fortune 500 giants to innovative startups. We will
expect you to go the extra mile, delivering solutions that solve immediate problems and drive long-term change. And we’ll rely on your judgment and
integrity to ensure our recommendations are effective and long-lasting.
You will take on a role that goes beyond advising. You’ll be at the heart of the action—helping to uncover the true challenges behind a client’s
strategy and creating actionable plans that drive real change. Working alongside clients and other McKinsey colleagues, you’ll combine research,
analyzing data, interviews, and brainstorming to generate fresh insights and breakthrough solutions. Your commitment to our values will be crucial in
earning our clients' trust and delivering results that matter.
As you collaborate directly with clients, you’ll help them solve problems, refine strategies, and implement transformations. By equipping them with
the tools and knowledge to continue innovating and improving after we’ve left, you’ll ensure the impact of our work endures. In doing so, you’ll
uphold McKinsey’s commitment to making a meaningful difference in the industries and communities we serve.
Your Growth
Driving lasting impact and building long-term capabilities with our clients is not easy work. You are the kind of person who thrives in a high
performance/high reward culture - doing hard things, picking yourself up when you stumble, and having the resilience to try another way forward.
In return for your drive, determination, and curiosity, we'll provide the resources, mentorship, and opportunities you need to become a stronger
leader faster than you ever thought possible. Your colleagues—at all levels—will invest deeply in your development, just as much as they invest in
delivering exceptional results for clients. Every day, you'll receive apprenticeship, coaching, and exposure that will accelerate your growth in ways
you won’t find anywhere else.
When you join us, you will have:
Continuous learning: Our learning and apprenticeship culture, backed by structured programs, is all about helping you grow while creating
an environment where feedback is clear, actionable, and focused on your development. The real magic happens when you take the input
from others to heart and embrace the fast-paced learning experience, owning your journey.
A voice that matters: From day one, we value your ideas and contributions. You’ll make a tangible impact by offering innovative ideas and
practical solutions. We not only encourage diverse perspectives, but they are critical in driving us toward the best possible outcomes.
Global community: With colleagues across 65+ countries and over 100 different nationalities, our firm’s diversity fuels creativity and helps
us come up with the best solutions for our clients. Plus, you’ll have the opportunity to learn from exceptional colleagues with diverse
backgrounds and experiences. World-class benefits: On top of a competitive salary (based on your location, experience, and skills), we provide a comprehensive benefits
package to enable holistic well-being for you and your family.
Your Qualifications and Skills
Typically, an undergraduate degree with less than 4 years of work experience; Requirements may vary by country or practice.
Excellent organization capabilities, including the ability to initiate tasks independently and see them through to completion.
Strong communication skills, both verbal and written, in English and local office language(s), with the ability to adjust your style to suit
different perspectives and seniority levels.
Proficient in rational decision making based on data, facts, and logical reasoning.
Ability to create work product-focused materials / outputs, which may include PowerPoint decks, Excel models, articles, or other written
deliverables.
Exceptional time management to meet your responsibilities in a complex and largely autonomous work environment.
Ability to work or attend meetings outside of traditional business hours or take on projects with limited or no notice at times.
Ability to travel to and work in varying environments that may be challenging and/or not accessible (e.g., factories, hospitals, mines)</div>
