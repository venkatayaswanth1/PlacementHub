            <h4>Job Description</h4>
            <div>Engineer, R&D (Rnd-SysE-COE)
The job profile has multiple tracks: 

1.	R&D track (candidate is involved in “proof of concepts” for new technology development)
2.	Systems engineering track (candidate is product owners involved in designing products that go into production, especially for new product lines)
3.	Applications engineering track (the role is like systems engineering, but more relevant for scaling existing product lines to high volumes)
4.	Control systems architect track (candidate works on writing control-intensive software that goes into production)
5.	Center of Excellence track (candidate focuses on engineering verticals such as FEA / CFD simulations)

All tracks will follow a common selection procedure, including a common written test. Once selected, the candidate will be assigned one of the above tracks based on the candidate's interests and the candidate's performance in the written tests and interviews.

About the job

The candidate is expected to participate in building technologies and products for automotive & off-highway powertrains such that the built products and technologies are deployed in large numbers world-wide. S/he is expected build technology differentiators and/or well-engineered robust products and work with a cross functional team to execute the same.

Major Responsibilities

The candidate will work on creating technology differentiators and/or robust in domains such as engine controls, motor controls, battery technology, electric machines and inertial measurement systems. The candidate will also likely have to lead a team of engineers depending on the nature of problem statement / product line assigned to the candidate. Depending on the track the candidate is assigned when the candidate joins SEDEMAC, the candidate’s day-to-day job will be a suitable subset of the below activities:

•	Develop a first principles understanding of the physics behind systems being considered; examples of systems being electric machines, IMUs, buck-boost converters, flux sensors, parasitic inductances of PCBs etc.
•	Mathematically model the system; design and conduct experiments to validate the hypothesized mathematical model.
•	Develop "methods/ strategies / circuits" to control / observe the system for desirable behaviour / insights. Examples being strategies and/or circuits for engine lambda control, inertial navigation etc.
•	Develop proof-of-concept demonstration of methods / strategies / circuits developed, on prototype ECUs (Electronic Control Units) through coordination with cross functional teams (such as hardware & software).
•	Develop electronics circuits, verify them in simulation domain, build the hardware, and test the built hardware for functionality and endurance.
•	Perform high-fidelity simulations in the domains of thermal engineering, structural mechanics, electromagnetics such that design decisions are based on simulation results.
•	Develop control-intensive embedded software that runs in the electronic control units which are deployed in mass volumes by SEDEMAC.
•	Write white-papers to document the methods / strategies / circuits developed.


Desired technical skills
•	Strong command over engineering physics and mathematics along with enthusiasm for potentially cross-domain ideas (mechanical, electrical etc.).
•	Skills in electronic instrumentation is desirable.
•	Experience with software development is desirable.
•	Experience with new product development is desirable.

Desired soft skills
•	Good written and verbal communication skills.

Engineer, Test Automation
About the job

“Engineer – Test Automation” is expected to design and develop “test systems” for enabling automated testing of electronic control units developed by SEDEMAC. The controllers to-be-tested are intended for applications such as engine controls, motor controls, battery management systems, automotive telematics devices etc.

Major Responsibilities

The candidate will primarily work on building test systems for testing of electronic control units designed within SEDEMAC during different stages of the product development life cycle (such as for integration-testing, end- of-line testing etc.). The candidate may also be required to build user-interface dashboards for performing activities such as calibration and debugging, to interface with the SEDEMAC’s ECUs; such user interfaces would typically be built on top of LabVIEW. The candidate may also be required to prepare rigs for experimental setups to enable physics-heavy experiments for supporting research activity ongoing at SEDEMAC. In the text that follows, the term “test-rig” refers to either “product test-rig”, “software dashboard” or “experimental setup”.

The candidate will be required to

•	Gather requirements and develop a systematic understanding of the controller to-be-tested and understand the context in which the controller operates.
•	Design the test-rig based on gathered requirements, while having design ownership of different aspects of the test-rig development activity, including software, mechanical, electronics.
•	Perform the “project manager” role for test-rig development activity, including planning delivery of the test-rig with pre-determined timelines, keep internal/external customers informed of the test-rig development state, and de-risking uncertainties during the development activity.
•	Prepare and document operation manuals, design architecture and learnings for the test-rigs developed. Also prepare validation-plan, maintenance-plan, periodic-calibration-plan for qualifying the test rigs developed.
•	Deploy the test rig and provide suitable training and support to end-users during the operating life of the test-rig.
•	Proactively identify new projects which can benefit from test-automation activity and prepare proof-of- concept to demonstrate its utility.
Technical Skills & Experience

•	LabVIEW experience is desirable.
•	Comfort with tools such as MATLAB, Python.
•	Good understanding of concepts of electronic, and operational familiarity with instruments such as oscilloscope, DC load bank, programmable power supply etc.
•	Comfort with engineering physics and mathematics along with enthusiasm for potentially cross- domain ideas (mechanical, electrical etc.).


Desired Soft skills

•	Good written and verbal communication skills.
•	Ability to work with a cross-functional team.
•	Professional attitude towards work.
•	Sense of ownership and urgency when working in the company.
•	Strong sense of ethics

Education:

•	Bachelors/Master's in Engineering (Electrical, Electronics, Mechanical, Chemical, Physics & Mathematics) (CGPA 6.0+)

Experience:

•	NA

Information on Selection Process

•	The selection process will be multi-phased tests plus interviews
•	There will be a focus on evaluating the candidate’s understanding of subject matter, expertise in leading hardware product development, project management, communication skills, analytical & logical skills
